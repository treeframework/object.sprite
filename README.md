# sprite

The `sprite` object simply creates spriting element abstraction.

## Dependencies

The `sprite` object depends on one other module:

* [settings.defaults](https://github.com/treeframework/settings.defaults)

If you install the `sprite` object using Bower or npm, you will get these 
dependencies at the same time. If not using Bower or npm, please be sure to 
install and `@import` these dependencies in the relevant way.

## Instalation

You can install the `sprite` module via Bower, npm, or copy and paste.

### Install using Bower:

```sh
$ bower install tree-sprite --save
```

Once installed, `@import` into your project in its Object layer:

```scss
@import "bower_components/tree-sprite/object.sprite";
```

### Install using npm:

```sh
$ npm install tree-sprite --save
```

### Install via file download

The least recommended option for installation is to simply download
`_object.sprite.scss` into your project and `@import` it into your project in
its Object layer.

## Usage

Basic usage of the `sprite` object uses the required classes:

```html
<i class="o-sprite">...</i>
```
